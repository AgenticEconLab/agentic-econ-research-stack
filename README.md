# Agentic Economics Research Tech Stack

> Curated documentation and resources for beginners exploring agentic AI frameworks and tools for economics research

## Overview

This repository provides beginner-friendly, curated documentation for key agentic AI tech stacks used in economics research. Whether you're building literature review agents for economic papers, data analysis workflows for econometric research, or multi-agent systems for economic modeling, this collection will help you get started with the right tools and frameworks.

**Note**: While this repository focuses on economics research applications, the frameworks, tools, and patterns documented here can be applied and extended to other scientific research disciplines including finance, political science, sociology, and more.

## Quick Start

1. **Choose a Framework**: Start with [LangChain](frameworks/langchain/) if you're new to agentic AI
2. **Explore Tools**: Check out [Vector Databases](tools/vector-databases/) for RAG applications with economic papers
3. **Learn Patterns**: Review [Common Patterns](patterns/) for economics research workflows
4. **See Examples**: Study [Complete Examples](examples/) for real-world economics research implementations

## Repository Structure

### 📚 [Frameworks](frameworks/)

Core agentic AI frameworks for building economics research agents:

- **[LangChain](frameworks/langchain/)** - Most popular, flexible framework for building LLM applications

- **[CrewAI](frameworks/crewai/)** - Role-based agent orchestration for collaborative tasks
- **[LangGraph](frameworks/langgraph/)** - Stateful agent workflows with graph-based execution
- **[AutoGPT](frameworks/autogpt/)** - Autonomous agent patterns and architectures

### 🛠️ [Tools](tools/)

Supporting tools and services for economics research:

- **[Vector Databases](tools/vector-databases/)** - Embedding storage for RAG with economic papers (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **[LLM Providers](tools/llm-providers/)** - API providers and open-source models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Open Source)
- **[Research Tools](tools/research-tools/)** - Specialized tools for economics research (PaperQA, ScholarAI, ArXiv tools)

### 🎯 [Patterns](patterns/)

Common patterns and best practices for economics research:

- **[Multi-Agent Collaboration](patterns/multi-agent-collaboration.md)** - Strategies for coordinating multiple agents in economic research
- **[Tool Use & Function Calling](patterns/tool-use-and-function-calling.md)** - Integrating external tools and APIs for economic data
- **[Memory & Context Management](patterns/memory-and-context-management.md)** - Managing agent memory for long-running economic research projects
- **[Research Workflows](patterns/research-workflows.md)** - Economics research-specific workflow patterns

### 💡 [Examples](examples/)

Complete, working examples for economics research:

- **[Literature Review Agent](examples/literature-review-agent.md)** - Automated discovery and analysis of economics papers
- **[Data Analysis Agent](examples/data-analysis-agent.md)** - Econometric analysis and visualization agents
- **[Hypothesis Testing Agent](examples/hypothesis-testing-agent.md)** - Automated hypothesis generation and testing for economic research

## Getting Started

### For Complete Beginners

1. Start with [LangChain Getting Started](frameworks/langchain/getting-started.md)
2. Read [Research Workflows](patterns/research-workflows.md) to understand common economics research patterns
3. Try the [Literature Review Agent](examples/literature-review-agent.md) example with economics papers

### For Experienced Developers

1. Compare frameworks in the [Frameworks](frameworks/) section
2. Review [Multi-Agent Collaboration](patterns/multi-agent-collaboration.md) patterns for complex economic modeling
3. Explore advanced examples in [Examples](examples/)

## Economics Research Use Cases

- **Literature Reviews**: Automate discovery and synthesis of economics papers
- **Data Analysis**: Build agents for econometric analysis and visualization
- **Economic Modeling**: Create multi-agent systems for economic simulations
- **Policy Analysis**: Develop agents for analyzing economic policies
- **Market Research**: Build agents for financial and market data analysis

## Applicability to Other Disciplines

While this repository focuses on economics research, the frameworks, tools, and patterns can be extended to:

- **Finance**: Financial modeling, market analysis, risk assessment
- **Political Science**: Policy analysis, voting behavior, international relations
- **Sociology**: Social network analysis, survey data analysis
- **Public Health**: Health economics, policy evaluation
- **Environmental Science**: Environmental economics, sustainability research

The core agentic AI concepts remain the same across disciplines—only the domain knowledge and specific tools change.
