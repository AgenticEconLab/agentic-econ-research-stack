# Research Tools

## Overview

Specialized tools for economics research that integrate with agentic AI frameworks. These tools help agents access economics papers, databases, and analysis tools.

## Tools

### [PaperQA](paper-qa.md)
- Question-answering over economics research papers
- Automatic economics paper retrieval and analysis

### [ScholarAI](scholar-ai.md)
- Access to academic databases for economics papers
- Economics paper search and metadata

### [ArXiv Tools](arxiv-tools.md)
- ArXiv economics paper search and retrieval
- Integration with agent frameworks for economics research

## Common Use Cases in Economics Research

- **Economics Literature Review**: Automated economics paper discovery and analysis
