# Agentic AI Patterns for Economics Research

## Overview

Common patterns and best practices for building agentic AI systems for economics research. These patterns can be applied across different frameworks and use cases.

**Note**: While these patterns focus on economics research, they can be adapted and extended to other scientific research disciplines including finance, political science, sociology, and more.

## Patterns

### [Multi-Agent Collaboration](multi-agent-collaboration.md)
Strategies for coordinating multiple agents working together on economics research tasks.

### [Tool Use and Function Calling](tool-use-and-function-calling.md)
Integrating external tools and APIs with agents for enhanced economics research capabilities.

### [Memory and Context Management](memory-and-context-management.md)
Managing agent memory and conversation context across economics research interactions.

### [Research Workflows](research-workflows.md)
Economics research-specific workflow patterns and best practices.

## When to Use Each Pattern

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Complex economics research tasks requiring specialized expertise (theorist, econometrician, policy analyst)
- **Tool Use**: Need for external economics data, APIs, or econometric computation
- **Memory Management**: Long-running economics research conversations or context-dependent tasks
- **Research Workflows**: Standard economics research processes (literature review, econometric analysis, etc.)

## Framework Compatibility

These patterns work with:
- LangChain
- AutoGen
- CrewAI
- LangGraph
- Other agent frameworks
